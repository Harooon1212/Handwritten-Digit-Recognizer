# Handwritten Digit Recognizer (CNN - Rotation Robust)

## Overview
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based handwritten digit recognizer trained on the MNIST dataset.  
The model is robust to rotations, translations, and scaling, enabling accurate predictions on both **drawn digits** and **uploaded images**.

A Streamlit GUI is included to allow users to:
- Draw a digit directly on a canvas for prediction
- Upload an image of a digit for prediction

---

## Features
- CNN architecture with rotation robustness
- Real-time predictions via Streamlit GUI
- Handles drawn digits and uploaded images
- Preprocessing matches MNIST format: white digits on black background
- Saved Keras model for easy deployment
